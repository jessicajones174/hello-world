# hello-world
As an aspiring data scientist, this is the first step in creating a public portfolio that displays my technical skills and qualifications. 

###### How I got here?
In 2013, I graduated with a degree in Math and Political Science from Emory University, and one of the most frustrating things looking back on my early career is how little I knew about how to apply my quantitative aptitude into value in the job market. What data science means to me is transitioning from theory and resuscitation, classroom skills, to applied knowledge and critical thinking skills as a methodologically trained professional.

###### What have I been up to?
For the past four years, I have served as a public health analyst at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, supporting mixed-method healthcare evaluations supporting quantitative and qualitative research tasks, as well as project management responsibilities. 
- Quantitative tasks include collaborating with programmers and analysts on programming requests, quality management, and data analysis tasks for our difference-in-difference model. 
- Qualitative tasks include managing data collection processes for surveys, participating in site visits, and coordinating, conducting, and coding phone interviews. 
- Project maangement tasks include collaborating with finanacial analyst and leadership team on labor forecasting for large multimillion dollar project, and serving as point-of-contact for client, subcontractors, consultants, and larger evalaution team.

Other experience includes serving as an AmeriCorps apprentice at Leadership Triangle, a nonprofit whose mission is to build leadership capacity and promote regionalism across Chatham, Durham, Orange, and Wake counties in North Carolina, also known as the Triangle area. My area of focus as an apprentice was capacity-building in nonprofit management through program coordination, marketing, and event manaagement activities.
